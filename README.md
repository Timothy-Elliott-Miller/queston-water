Queston water is a demonstration of two dimensional block water that employs simple algorithms like quick sort to calculate water bodies and simulate somewhat realistic liquid flow. It avoids using 'particle simulation', where each particle of water must have it's pressure calculated to direct it's velocity. Instead water bodies are sorted and water blocks flow to any available exits lower than the highest water in the body. Updates cycle the numbers representing the water bodies so that each block of water is accurately numbered according to the water it is connected to.
